House Price Prediction Project

Objective:
Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using various regression techniques.

Data:
Utilized a dataset with features such as square footage, grade, and living space.

Techniques:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized data.
Feature Engineering: Selected relevant features for the model.
Modeling: Implemented and compared multiple regression models:
Linear Regression: RMSE = 262,421.85
Random Forest Regression: RMSE = 260,723.33
Support Vector Regression (SVR): RMSE = 285,307.52
Gradient Boosting Regression: RMSE = 249,010.41


Evaluation:
Assessed model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Outcome:
The Gradient Boosting Regression model achieved the lowest RMSE and was selected as the best model.

Deployment:
Predicted the price of new houses and saved the best model for future use.
